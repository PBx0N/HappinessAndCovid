# HappinessAndCovid

## Project proposal
The aim of this project is to find the impact of COVID mortility on happiness. The World Happiness Report (WHR) conducts a yearly global survey and collects the data to report how people evaluate their own lives in over 150 countries worldwide. Through the last 10 years WHR delivered the happiness outcomes based on the avaraged scores collected for each country by accessing their subjective well-being divided into 6 categories (Income, Social Support, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Corruption). 

From 2020 until today, pandemic had a tremendoud impact on human health and freedom affecting our overall happiness. 
The World Health Oragnization (WHO) monitors and daily updates the number of people affected by COVID across the whole world. 

In this project we aim to combine both sources of data and find how the last two years of living in pandemic shaped the outcomes of the World Happiness.

## Findings

Through the last three years (2020-2022) mainly Norden countries reported the highest scores in happiness survey, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland*, Iceland, Norway and Sweden found at the top of the ranking. In the last two years a decrease in happiness scores was registered for THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, while THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES reported higher content with their lives regardless of the pandemic. Altough, the happiest 5 countries scored less in the survey in the last two years, they maintained their high positions. The number of COVID-caused deaths in these countries accounted for 0.05-0.1% of the total population (<10M), which is relatively low when compared to more populated countries which lost nearly 1% of their population. These findings suggest that Happy Countries' Social Support (including medical assistance) may play important roles in well-being and reported happiness. Switzerland, altough not part of Nordic countries, is also renowned for their socialist policies as well as one of the highest GDP per capita in the world.
