# HappinessAndCovid

## Project proposal
The aim of this project is to find the impact of COVID mortility on happiness. The World Happiness Report (WHR) conducts a yearly global survey and collects the data to report how people evaluate their own lives in over 150 countries worldwide. Through the last 10 years WHR delivered the happiness outcomes based on the avaraged scores collected for each country by accessing their subjective well-being divided into 6 categories (Income, Social Support, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Corruption). 

From 2020 until today, pandemic had a tremendoud impact on human health and freedom affecting their overall happiness. 
The World Health Oragnization (WHO) delivers daily updates on the number of people affected by COVID across the whole world. 

In this project we aim to combine both sources of data and find how the last two years living in pandemic shaped the outcomes of World Happiness.

## Findings

Through the last three years (2020-2022) Scandinavian countries reported the highest scores in happiness survey, Finland sitting at the top of the ranking.
